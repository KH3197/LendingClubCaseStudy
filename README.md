## General Information
- This project analyzes loan defaults and risk factors within the lending industry.
- The project aims to address the business problem of identifying indicators of loan defaults for risk assessment.
- The dataset used for this analysis consists of lending data from an online loan marketplace.

## Goal of analysis
-Lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss
(called credit loss). The credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender 
when the borrower refusesto pay or runs away with the money owed.  

-The main objective is to be able to identify these risky loan applicants, 
then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. 
Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.   

-Perform an analysis to understand the driving factors (or driver variables)
behind loan default, i.e.the variables which are strong indicators of default.  
The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.

## Conclusions
- Borrowers with employment lengths of 10 years or more and 7 years are more susceptible to loan default, potentially due to limited time for repayment and increased personal liabilities.
- No significant relationship was observed between homeownership categories and loan defaults.
- Certain states (NV, AK, SD, FL, NM, HI, GA, MO, CA) exhibit higher susceptibility to default loans and warrant further in-depth analysis.
- Charged-off loans show significantly more inquiries in the past 6 months, indicating the importance of monitoring recent credit inquiries.
- Best practices from 2008 contributed to a remarkable decline in 'Charged Off' percentages. Investigating these practices may enhance risk management strategies.
- Loans with 60-month terms are correlated with higher default rates, suggesting the need for adjusted lending criteria.
- Loans with higher interest rates are more likely to default, emphasizing the importance of risk-based pricing.
- While the debt-to-income ratio (dti) is slightly higher for 'Charged Off' loans, the difference is marginal, making it inconclusive as a sole indicator.
- Categories D, E, F, and G loans are more susceptible to default, while A, B, and C categories are more likely to be fully paid.
